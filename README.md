## Setup

To set up environment variables for your Express.js application, follow these steps:

1. Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of your project.
2. Open the `.env` file and add the following lines:

   ```
   DB_HOST=<your_database_host>
   DB_USER=<your_database_user>
   DB_PASSWORD=<your_database_password>
   DB_DATABASE=<your_database_name>
   ```

   Replace `<your_database_host>`, `<your_database_user>`, `<your_database_password>`, and `<your_database_name>` with the appropriate values for your database connection.
   For example:

   ```
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=myuser
   DB_PASSWORD=mypassword
   DB_DATABASE=ca1bed
   ```

   Note: Make sure there are no spaces around the equal sign (=) in each line.

3. Save the `.env` file.

## Database Initialization & Add Data

1. To initialize the database tables and populate them with sample data, open the terminal in VSCode and run the following command:

   ```
   npm run init_tables
   ```
